    "explanation": "Function defines 12 local variables; consider splitting into smaller functions.. A large number of local variables often indicates that the function is doing too much and is hard to reason about.",
    "suggestion": "Split the function into smaller, focused helpers, each handling a clear subtask. This reduces cognitive load and makes testing easier."
